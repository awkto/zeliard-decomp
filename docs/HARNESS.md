# Differential test harness (epic #46, Phase A)

Goal: run the **original game** (DOSBox-X, "the oracle") and **`port/`** from the
same inputs, frame by frame, and report the first frame where they disagree, with
named fields and a picture. No human playtesting.

Status: being built (#47 oracle, #48 port trace + diff, #49 scenarios, #50 monkey,
#51 triage). This file is the contract between the pieces; change it first.

## 1. The game frame

Both main loops end a frame by busy-waiting until `FF1A >= 4*speed`, then zeroing it
with the same instruction, `C6 06 1A FF 00` = `mov byte [0xff1a],0`:

| Loop | Overlay @6000 | Site |
|---|---|---|
| caverns | fight.bin | `717F` |
| towns | town.bin | `68ED` |

**Frame boundary** = the CPU is about to execute that instruction at `BASE:site`.
At that point the frame's logic and drawing are finished. Inputs applied at a
boundary are what the *next* frame reads. Other loops (shops, status screen,
cutscenes) are out of scope for v1. A boundary in any other place is logged as an
unknown site, not traced.

`BASE` (the one 64 KB segment that STICK, the drivers and the overlays share) =
the segment of the `INT 61h` vector (STICK's input service at `BASE:05FD`).

## 2. Inputs

The port's `--script` language is the input language for both sides: `U D L R`
directions, `X` sword, `M` magic, `E` Enter, `K` the LEVEL/EXP chord, `.N` idle,
a number = hold for N frames (`R10`, `UR2`, `X1`). One token-frame = one game frame.

The oracle applies frame `n`'s inputs at boundary `n-1`. v1 writes the kernel's
input state directly (`FF17` dirs, `FF16` buttons, `FF1D`/`FF1E` press edges,
`FF18` key mask), exactly as STICK's INT 9 would leave it. This is deterministic
and independent of keyboard-controller timing. Real scancode injection is a later
option for menu keys.

## 3. Determinism

- Fixed `cycles`, `core=normal`, no frame limiter. Emulated time is then a pure
  function of the inputs.
- **Random numbers.** Kernel `[11A]` (`STICK:0918`) mixes `FF1B`, the free-running
  tick count, *at call time*, which depends on CPU speed. That cannot be reproduced
  by the port. In harness mode both sides return the **harness RNG** instead:
  `state = state*25173 + 13849` (u16, seed 0 at trace frame 0), one step per call,
  and nothing else. The oracle intercepts `BASE:0918` and returns `AX = state`.
  The port's `krn_random` does the same when tracing, without the `+20` per-frame
  stir. **The number of RNG calls per frame is itself a traced field.**
- Start state: both sides start from the same `NAME.USR` save. The oracle boots,
  skips the intro and F7-restores it; the port uses `--load NAME`. Trace frame 0 =
  the first boundary after the restore. RNG and counters are reset there.

## 4. Trace format

### Oracle (`tools/oracle.sh` → `DIR/`)
- `DIR/frames.jsonl`: one line per boundary:
  `{"f":n,"site":"717F","base":"0x1234","rng_calls":k,"input":"R"}`
- `DIR/base.bin`: for every boundary, the full 65536 bytes of segment `BASE`,
  concatenated (frame `n` at offset `n*65536`).
- `DIR/frame_NNNNN.png` (optional, every `--png-every K` frames): the 320x200 screen
  from VGA memory + DAC.

The oracle stays dumb on purpose: raw memory, no field names. Names live in the
schema.

### Port (`zeliard --trace DIR`)
- `DIR/frames.jsonl`: one line per frame with the same keys, plus `"fields":{...}`:
  named values for every schema field the port models.
- `DIR/frame_NNNNN.png` at the same cadence.

### Schema (`tools/harness/fields.tsv`)
`name  addr  size  mode  note`: `mode` is `fight`, `town` or `any`. Names come from
`docs/STATE_PAGE.md` / `docs/FIGHT.md`. `tracediff` decodes the oracle's `base.bin`
through it. Fields the port does not model are simply absent from its `fields`.

### Diff (`tools/tracediff.py ORACLE_DIR PORT_DIR`)
Aligns by `f`, reports the first frame where a field differs (name, both values),
writes `oracle | port | diff` PNGs around it, and exits non-zero. Fields that
legitimately differ go in an explicit, commented allow-list.

## 5. Where it runs

The oracle is a separate debug build of DOSBox-X: upstream `dosbox-x-v2026.08.02`
plus `tools/harness/oracle-dosbox-x.patch` **only** (none of the zeliard-wasm
shipping patches, which change input behaviour). Heavy builds and big batches run on
a `claude-test` DigitalOcean droplet. pro runs single scenarios at `nice -n 19`.
